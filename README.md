This is my first attempt at a portfolia site.

I decide to build this without the use of framworks, such as bootstrap or materialze or even font aswome. Wanted to show my basic HTML and CSS skills.

I did however utilize SASS even though sass was a bit over kill for a small project I wanted to show that I understood how to use Node to install NPM packages and use sass veriables and structure.
